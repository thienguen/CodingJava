        All of our test methods are now implemented, and our test are passing.
        We'd want to write more test cases to cover scenarios the existing ones don't test,
        but we'll pretend we're done. We could stop here, but every one of the test cases
        starts by creating an instance of the Utilities class. Modify the UtilitiesTest class
        so that it doesn't have this repetitive code.

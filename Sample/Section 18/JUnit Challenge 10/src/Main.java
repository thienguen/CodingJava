        Test the following inputs and outputs.
        You could add all these tests to the existing test method,
        or write a method for each set of input/output,
        but that wouldn't be the best way to do it.

        Do it in such a way that you only have to write one test method.
        Hint: You'll have to create a new class that's using a particular JUnit annotation.

        Input = "ABCDEFF", Output = "ABCDEF"
        Input = "AB88EFFG", Output = "AB8EFG"
        Input = "112233445566", Output = "123456"
        Input = "ZYZQQB", Output = "ZYZQB"
        Input = "A", Output = "A"
